# EDUNET-Project
## Project Overviwe:
This project uses three different machine learning models—Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, and Random Forest—to predict employee burnout using data-driven insights. Every model undergoes training on an extensive dataset that includes variables pertaining to the behavior of employees and the workplace, including hours worked, job demands, and employee feedback. In order to provide human resource strategies with useful information, it is intended to assess and contrast how well these models predict burnout. In the end, this study will not only identify the best model for predicting burnout but will also be a useful resource for companies looking to improve worker productivity and well-being.
## End Users:
Human Resources Departments: The primary users of the prediction model to detect and assist employees who are at risk of burnout are the human resources departments.
Organizational Leaders and Managers: Managers and organizational leaders can make greater use of insights to modify team assignments and enhance management procedures to increase employee engagement.
Health and Wellness Coordinators: The role of health and wellness coordinators is to create focused wellness initiatives that target the particular pressures that lead to burnout.
Data Analysts and IT Staff: IT personnel and data analysts: Participate in the upkeep and incorporation of the predictive system into corporate IT infrastructures.
Employees: Based on the model's projections, indirect beneficiaries through enhanced working conditions and well-being programs.
## Solution:
Predictive modeling: It improves early intervention skills by effectively predicting employee burnout from a variety of workplace-related characteristics through the use of Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and Linear Regression algorithms.
Value Proposition: Enables businesses to take a proactive approach to managing employee health, which lowers expenses related to burnout, including absenteeism, turnover, and lost productivity, and eventually promotes a more productive and long-lasting work environment.
## Modelling:
Three different machine learning models were used in the employee burnout prediction project: Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and Linear Regression, to investigate and forecast burnout levels. Every model was meticulously selected and set up to make the most use of the features in the dataset, which include demographic data, employee workload, and satisfaction scores. For the purpose of binary burnout likelihood categorization, logistic regression was utilized, while random forest was chosen due to its resilience while working with non-linear data and its capacity to prioritize different characteristics. Linear regression was utilized to comprehend continuous relationships. To ensure accuracy and reduce overfitting, the models underwent extensive training, validation, and testing on a split dataset. Performance metrics like RMSE, accuracy, and F1 score were employed to assess each model's capacity to predict burnout. With the use of this multi-model approach, employee burnout may be thoroughly analyzed, yielding useful information for preventative measures.
